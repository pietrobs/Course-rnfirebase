# My journey

I started that project with the installation of Basic Kit on https://rnfirebase.io/docs/v5.x.x/installation/basic-kit

After the git clone just follow the steps, but in the third step you must to go on firebase console (https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/) to create a new project.

Now you need to insert the Firebase in your App Android, to do that just click in the android icon and follow the steps, in React Native you can stop these steps after downloading the file 'google-services.json'.

Place this file in the android/app/ directory of your project.

Run 'npm install' to install all the node_modules and 'react-native run-android'
